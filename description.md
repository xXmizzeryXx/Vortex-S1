The Vortex S1 is a mini-styled super 3D printer, capable of Multi-Color printing, smart adjusting, and NO supports.
Built on the backbone of absolutely nothing, this printer is HANDMADE. From the ground up, all of the coding, parts, design.
The main thing that sets this printer apart is that there is no screen on the printer. This maximizes the space for printing and leads to a more minimal design.
The printer is controlled from a private website, where you will gain access with a code if used. The website allows uploads for G-Code files, immedient temperature controls, and subtle changes to G-Code mid-print.
