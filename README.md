# 🌀 Vortex E1 — Open-Source CoreXY 3D Printer Project
**Fast. Quiet. Modular. Built by makers, for makers.**

The **Vortex E1** is an open-source CoreXY 3D printer currently in design and prototyping.  
The goal: create a **reliable, high-speed, and fully moddable** 3D printer that any maker can build, upgrade, and tune without proprietary restrictions.

---

## 🚀 Vision
The **Vortex E1** isn’t a clone or a remix — it’s a ground-up design that merges *engineering precision* with *maker accessibility*.  
This printer is built to be a **platform**, not a product — something you can print, assemble, modify, and make truly your own.

> Designed for real-world printing — not just pretty renders.

---

## 🧱 Design Philosophy
- **CoreXY Motion System** — balanced speed and accuracy  
- **Direct-Drive Extrusion** — handles TPU and technical filaments  
- **Rigid Aluminum Frame** — rock-solid foundation for consistent prints  
- **Klipper Firmware** — lightning-fast motion control and input shaping  
- **Modular Design** — easy to enclose, upgrade, and maintain  
- **Fully Open Hardware** — all CAD, STLs, and firmware public and editable
